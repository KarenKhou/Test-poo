Tic Tac Toe with AI

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It features a 4x4 grid and allows the player to play against an AI using the Minimax algorithm with optional Alpha-Beta pruning.

Features

4x4 Tic Tac Toe: Play on a larger board for increased complexity.

Multiple Difficulty Levels:

Easy: Random moves with some heuristic influence.

Medium: Minimax with depth limit.

Hard: Minimax with deeper depth limit.

AI with Minimax Algorithm: The AI uses the Minimax search algorithm for optimal decision-making.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optionally enables pruning to improve search efficiency.

Statistics Tracking: Displays search depth, total nodes generated, and pruning occurrences.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with Tkinter, offering an interactive and easy-to-use interface.

How to Play

Run the script TicTacToe.py.

Choose who plays first: Human or Computer.

Select the AI search algorithm:

Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning (faster search)

Minimax without pruning (slower but comprehensive search)

Select difficulty level:

Easy

Medium

Hard

Play by clicking on the desired cell to place your move.

The game continues until a winner is found or the board is full.

You can restart the game using the "Reset" button.
